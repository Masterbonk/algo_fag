\problemname{Compare numbers}

You are teaching your small cousin about numbers, but he is having trouble grasping that some numbers are bigger, smaller or equal.
You have a D&D session, but you do not want to leave him hanging, so you wanna make a program that can help him. 

Create a program that takes two integers, and returns either $"bigger"$, $"smaller"$ or $"equal"$. Depending on how the first integer relates to the second integer.

\section*{Input}

The input consists of two integers, given on two lines.
Every integer is a nonnegative integer in the range $0$ to $100$.

\section*{Output}

The output should be one string, that follows this format.
i1 > i2 outputs: $"bigger"$
i1 < i2 outputs: $"smaller"$ 
i1 = i2 outputs: $"equal"$
